			<p>David Bowie always said that he was a writer and actor first and a musician second. He initially wanted a career in writing musicals and songs for others to perform, however, quickly found out that it wasn’t as simple and that he would have to perform the songs himself. That didn't stop him from creating and adopting multiple stage personas which in turn led to the creation of his iconic style and let him build his audience. Bowie's career represented reinvention and relied on visual presentation.</p> <br>
			<p>The number of characters Bowie adopted during his career is unsure since the lines between two personas are often blurred. However, his fans are familiar with five dominant and different characters he created throughout the years. These characters were created while the musician was embarking on different eras and the requirements of contemporary music.</p>

			<p>While always primarily a musician, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions. Bowie's acting career was "productively selective", largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts. Many critics have observed that, had Bowie not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor. Other critics have noted that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as Lost Highway, A Knight's Tale, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Inglourious Basterds.<br><br>During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone named him among the greatest artists in history and — after his passing — the "greatest rock star ever". In 2022, Bowie was announced as the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.
