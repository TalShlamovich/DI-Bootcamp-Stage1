			<p>David Bowie always said that he was a writer and actor first and a musician second. He initially wanted a career in writing musicals and songs for others to perform, however, quickly found out that it wasn’t as simple and that he would have to perform the songs himself. That didn't stop him from creating and adopting multiple stage personas which in turn led to the creation of his iconic style and let him build his audience. Bowie's career represented reinvention and relied on visual presentation.</p> <br>
			<p>The number of characters Bowie adopted during his career is unsure since the lines between two personas are often blurred. However, his fans are familiar with five dominant and different characters he created throughout the years. These characters were created while the musician was embarking on different eras and the requirements of contemporary music.</p>
