# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String Module
# Instructions
# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Current Date
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.

# Exercise 5 : Amount Of Time Left Until January 1st
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01hours).

a = today
b = date(2023,1,1)
print(b-a)

# Exercise 6 : Birthday And Minutes
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a birthdate as an argument (in the format of your choice),
# then displays a message stating how many minutes the user lived in his life.
